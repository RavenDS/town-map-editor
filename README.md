# DS Town Map Editor

A tool to edit Town positions, Fly Locations, and descriptions displayed within the DPPt Town Map!

## Notes:
- <b>You might need to enable « High DPI Scaling Override »</b>
- To make a valid Fly Location, the Header must be both on the Matrix, in the Fly list and as an actual Town/City <b>(all 3)</b>
- The number of towns is currently limited to 20 (requires Overlay expansion)
- Japanese ROMs are not supported for various reasons
